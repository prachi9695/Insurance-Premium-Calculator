# Insurance Premium Calculator

## Overview
An interactive web application that calculates insurance premiums based on risk factors and telematics data, demonstrating how data-driven insights can improve pricing accuracy.

## Business Value
Traditional insurance pricing relies on demographic factors, but telematics data provides behavioral insights that more accurately reflect individual risk profiles, resulting in fairer pricing.

## Features
- **Risk Assessment Algorithm**: Evaluates multiple factors to determine premium
- **Telematics Integration**: Incorporates driving behavior data
- **Interactive Interface**: User-friendly design for inputting customer information
- **Transparent Pricing**: Breakdown of how different factors affect the premium

## Methodology
1. **Risk Factor Analysis**: Identified key variables affecting insurance risk
2. **Algorithm Development**: Created weighted scoring system for:
   - Driver demographics (age, location, history)
   - Vehicle characteristics (type, age, safety features)
   - Driving behavior (mileage, braking patterns, speed)
3. **Rate Calculation**: Implemented actuarial formulas for premium determination
4. **Web Application**: Developed user interface for data input and results display

## Results
- Created granular risk profiles for more personalized pricing
